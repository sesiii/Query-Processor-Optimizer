Title
Query Processor and Optimizer
Abstract
Efficient query processing is a cornerstone of database management systems, balancing
performance and resource utilization. This project aims to develop a query processor and
optimizer that parses SQL-like queries, constructs computation graphs, generates execu-
tion plans, and estimates operational costs. Leveraging Bison and Flex, we will build
a parser to translate queries into a structured format. The system will then produce
optimized execution plans, inspired by PostgreSQL and SQLite, incorporating basic op-
timizations such as selection pushdown and join reordering, as outlined in Silberschatz et
al.’s ”Database System Concepts.” Cost estimation will rely on simplified table statistics
and operation complexity. By integrating systems-level tools with database theory, this
project will deliver a functional prototype that demonstrates query transformation and
cost-aware optimization within a constrained timeline.
Weekly Work Plan
Week 1: March 17–23, 2025 (Proposal Submission)
•Finalize project scope and objectives.
•Research query processing and optimization (Silberschatz Ch. 13–14).
•Draft and submit proposal.
•Set up Bison and Flex for SQL-like grammar.
•Implement parser to generate abstract syntax tree (AST).
1
•Convert AST to basic computation graph for simple queries.
Week 2: March 24–30, 2025 (Parser and Computation Graph)
•Generate initial execution plans (e.g., relational algebra).
•Develop basic cost estimation model (I/O and CPU costs).
•Test with single-table and join queries.
Week 3: March 31–April 6, 2025 (Execution Plan and Cost Estimation)
•Implement selection pushdown and join reordering optimizations.
•Compare costs of optimized vs. unoptimized plans.
•Test with diverse queries and debug.
Week 4: April 14–15, 2025 (Finalization and Submission)
•Polish code and validate results.
•Write final report and prepare demo.
•Submit by April 15, 2025.

we are to implement this from scratch, a relational algebra tree hence created, should them be sent into the optimizer for optimization and therefor print an optimized relational algebra tree

Query Processor + Optimizer
Process a given query to generate its computation graph
You can use tools like bison & flex for this part
Generate a plan (like psql or sqlite) and estimate the cost of the operation
Perform basic optimizations as in Silberschatz
LETS START, lets target to complete atleast generating relation algebra tree today
